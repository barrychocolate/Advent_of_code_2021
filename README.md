# Advent_of_code_2021
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

You donâ€™t need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

This project is my Python solution to those problems.

You can view the code in my advent2021 repository.

It is also published using Github Pages which can be viewed at https://barrychocolate.github.io/Advent_of_code_2021/index.html
